# A-programmer-s-guide-to-a-healthy-worklife
Short: An alarm guide to exercise healthy habits while building your code.

Every programmer is expected to spend half of their day, sometimes until midnight, in front of a screen, writing code.

We can use Python's time and pygame modules to set short alarms to remind ourselves to do simple exercises while we work. I wrote this code entirely on my own to assist my fellow programmers out there, punching keyboards.


Requirements -
You will need to import following things -

Mixer from pygame module

Datetime from datetime module

Time

This will also generate and save a timestamp indicating when and where you performed what activity in a file format.

Also, if two activity timings collide, the program will handle that as well. I hope you enjoy it.
